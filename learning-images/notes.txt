Why you should use alt text in your images? 

- The user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader
to read the web out to them. In fact, having alt text
available to describe images is useful to most users.

- As described above, the spelling of the file or path name might be wrong.

- The browser doesn't support the image type. Some people still use text-only browsers,
    such as Lynx, which displays the alt text of images.

- You may want to provide text for search engines to utilize; 
  for example, search engines can match alt text with search queries.

- Users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions. 
This is especially common on mobile phones, 
and in countries where bandwidth is limited or expensive.

    Ways of inserting images on the web page:

    <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
    <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
    
    Search engines also read image filenames and count them towards SEO. 
    Therefore, you should give your image a descriptive filename;
     dinosaur.jpg is better than img835.png.
     
     <img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />

     Linking via absolute URLs is not recommended, however. 
     You should host the images you want to use on your site, 
     which in simple setups means keeping the images for your
      website on the same server as your HTML. This will make it easier 
      for the mantainance of the website.

    Decoration. You should use CSS background images for decorative images, 
    but if you must use HTML, add a blank alt="". 
    If the image isn't part of the content, 
    a screen reader shouldn't waste time reading it.

Note: Although, as we have said, it is good practice to specify the 
actual size of your images using HTML attributes, 
you should not use them to resize images.

If you set the image size too big, you'll end up with images that look grainy,
 fuzzy, or too small, and wasting bandwidth downloading an image 
 that is not fitting the user's needs. The image may also end up looking distorted,
  if you don't maintain the correct aspect ratio. 
  You should use an image editor to put your image at the correct size
   before putting it on your webpage.

If you do need to alter an image's size, you should use CSS instead.
